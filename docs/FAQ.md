# Frequently Asked Questions

This document contains a few frequently asked questions (known as "FAQ") regarding the Cardinal project.

## Why does Cardinal exist?

Many reasons, most of them described on the [README](../README.md#why).  
But basically we want an open-source plugin version of "Rack Pro",
where we are free to change things as we see fit, work on new features and fix bugs.  
This is simply not possible with proprietary software, which is the case of "Rack Pro".

## Can I install extra modules?

No, Cardinal is intentionally a fully self-contained plugin.  
Whatever is contained in the current build is what you can use.  
The exceptions to this are loading files from within a module (like samples)
and regular plugin hosting (using Carla or Ildaeil modules to LV2, VST2, etc).

Adding new modules to Cardinal is only possible by making them be part of build.  
As such it is only possible to include open-source modules.

## So how do I actually add new modules to Cardinal?

By setting up the build to include them.  
This means forking the project, adding git submodules and changing Makefiles.  
Details on this are available [here](https://github.com/DISTRHO/Cardinal/discussions/28).

Due to the highly technical details to sort out for it, such task might not be possible for you at this point.  
Consider just requesting the inclusion of a specific module instead.

Worth noting that, just because a plugin/module is open-source, it does not mean that it can be included in Cardinal.  
Many modules have very strict license terms on the use of its artwork,
or the code can have a license not compatible with Cardinal.  
As a rule of thumb, you can follow these simple rules:

- If module/plugin project license is `GPL-3.0-only` it is not allowed in Cardinal (we want `GPL-3.0-or-later` compatible licenses)
- If the artwork license states "used and distributed with permission", we need to ask for explicit permission to use it
- If the artwork license prohibits derivatives and panels have white or very-bright backgrounds, we need explicit permission for a runtime dark mode

If none of the above apply, it is likely the module is usable as part of Cardinal.  
Also check [this wiki page](https://github.com/DISTRHO/Cardinal/wiki/Possible-modules-to-include)
where we discuss possible modules to include.

## Changes are lost on restart

This is intentional. Unlike VCV Rack, Cardinal does not automatically save.

Also, different variants (main vs FX vs Synth) use different files for saving their settings, so there might be some confusion arising from that.  
But on the other hand this allows you to have a different template and other defaults per variant, which is quite handy.

## Scaling/High-DPI not working properly, how to fix it?

Cardinal, using [DPF](https://github.com/DISTRHO/DPF), will try to automatically detect the system scaling and adjust to that.  
On cases where that does not work you can set `DPF_SCALE_FACTOR` environment variable to a value of your choosing in order to force a custom scale factor.  
Note that this applies to all DPF-based plugins and not just Cardinal.

## On BSD/Linux/X11 the menu item "Save As/Export..." does nothing

Cardinal relies on [xdg-desktop-portal](https://github.com/flatpak/xdg-desktop-portal)
for save file dialogs. Typically a desktop environment (DE) handles this,
lightweight setups without DEs may require extra work.

To make the dialogs appear, first install `xdg-desktop-portal` and one of its
backends (`xdg-desktop-portal-gtk` is a good default option). Then you'll need
to set up environment variables for portal to work, like this:

```bash
dbus-update-activation-environment --systemd DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS DISPLAY XAUTHORITY
```

It's recommended that you add this command to `~/.xinitrc` so that runs
automatically every time you boot your system.

## Why IRC and not Discord?

Discord terms of service are absolute garbage and have no place on a free open-source project.

Don't take it from us, here are a few articles and discussions about it:

- https://drewdevault.com/2021/12/28/Dont-use-Discord-for-FOSS.html
- https://stallman.org/discord.html
- https://discourse.ardour.org/t/ardour-discord-server/88399/
- https://discuss.haiku-os.org/t/discord-server/6519/

Maybe some Matrix channel could be setup, but it would need to bridge to IRC.  
For now IRC works perfectly for Cardinal's authors, so there is no real reason to change.
